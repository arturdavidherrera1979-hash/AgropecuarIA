# Vision

One-liner
- End-to-end precision agriculture service that uses drones + sensors + AI to increase profit per hectare.

Who we serve (first hypothesis)
- Medium/large producers with recurring monitoring + targeted application needs.
- Advisors/agronomists who want higher resolution data.

What we deliver (initial scope)
- Data capture: drone flights + sensors (where applicable).
- Insights: maps/alerts/recommendations (actionable).
- Operations: support or execution for targeted applications.

Success metrics (draft)
- Cost reduction per hectare (inputs + labor).
- Yield/productivity uplift (where measurable).
- Time-to-insight after capture.
- Producer retention/renewal rate.

Risks / unknowns
- Regulatory constraints and permissions.
- Weather windows and operational logistics.
- Model reliability across crops/regions.
